Weather and Vacation Analysis

In this project, I developed some Python scripts to visualize weather patterns across 500 cities and create map visualizations for vacation planning using the OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify APIs. 

Conducted linear regression analysis to explore relationships between weather variables and latitude.

Here's a few screenshots of some of the visualizations I created in order to show reltionships between Latitude (location) and Weather Attributes (temperature, humidity):

This kind of work would be useful to provide to people looking to use up their PTO, they can use the analysis to see whether the place they wish to travel will have good weather, and also what hotels they could potentially stay at in the area.

My core responsibilities in this analysis were data collection, visualization creation, and statistical analysis using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, and geoViews.
